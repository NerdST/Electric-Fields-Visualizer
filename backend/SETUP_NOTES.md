# Setup and Current Status

## What You Have Now

✅ **Complete backend server architecture**
- WebSocket server (uWebSockets)
- Session management per user
- Binary protocol for efficient data transfer
- Vulkan initialization (uses CPU fallback for compute)

✅ **Frontend client code**
- WebSocket client with reconnection
- Remote FDTD wrapper
- Remote implementation component

⚠️ **Currently using CPU fallback**
- Vulkan is initialized correctly
- But compute shaders aren't loaded yet
- So it falls back to CPU (slow but works)

## Will You Have a Working Implementation?

**Yes, but with caveats:**

1. **Backend server works** - You can start it, it will accept connections
2. **Frontend can connect** - WebSocket connection will work
3. **Data will transfer** - Protocol is implemented
4. **Simulation runs** - But on CPU (slow) until you add SPIR-V shaders

**What you'll have:**
- Same functionality as your current local simulation
- But running on backend server instead of browser
- Multiple users can connect simultaneously
- Ready to move to a more powerful GPU server later

**What's missing for full GPU acceleration:**
- SPIR-V shader compilation (convert WGSL → SPIR-V)
- Shader loading in VulkanManager
- Proper Vulkan buffer management (currently using malloc)

## Quick Test

1. **Build backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```
   ✅ Build should now succeed!

2. **Run server**:
   ```bash
   ./fdtd_server
   ```
   Server will start on port 8080 by default

3. **In frontend**, use `ChargeImplementationRemote.tsx`
4. Should connect and work (slowly, using CPU fallback)

## Fixed Issues

- ✅ Missing Compression.cpp/h files (created stubs)
- ✅ uWebSockets dependency (cloned from GitHub)
- ✅ uSockets submodule (manually cloned)
- ✅ WebSocket template parameters (fixed to use EmptyUserData)
- ✅ Missing includes (cstring, stdexcept, cstdint)
- ✅ CMakeLists.txt updated for Vulkan and uWebSockets paths

## Next Steps for Full GPU

See `backend/README.md` for details on completing Vulkan compute shader integration.
